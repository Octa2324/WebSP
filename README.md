# WebSP

A full-stack web application that allows users to access and play games developed by me using Unity. The application is built with a Spring Boot backend, an Angular frontend, and a PostgreSQL database. It includes functionality for user login with JWT token-based authentication and Spring Security to secure endpoints.

The application showcases games hosted in a dynamic platform where users can log in, view the games, and play directly in the browser.
